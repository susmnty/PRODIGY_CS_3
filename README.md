# PRODIGY_CS_3
This task 3 which is given by Prodigy - Password Complexity Checker 

The provided Python program checks how strong a password is by looking at several factors: its length, and whether it contains uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The check_password_strength function examines the password using regular expressions to see if it meets these criteria and assigns a score based on how many it fulfills. Depending on the score, the program rates the password as very weak, weak, good, strong, or very strong, and gives tips on how to make it better if needed. The main function interacts with the user, asking them to enter a password, checking its strength using the check_password_strength function, and then displaying the results. Users can keep checking different passwords until they choose to exit the program. This way, users get immediate feedback on their password security and suggestions for improvement.

To understand very well run the Code in the compiler.
